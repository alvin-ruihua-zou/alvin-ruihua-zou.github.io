In this project I programmed a six degree of freedom robotic arm to stack Jenga blocks using matlab. The task was to retrieve Jenga blocks from a feeder and stack them in the designated area into a 3 layered tower, where each layer consisted of three Jenga blocks. The task was completed using inverse kinematics to calculate the waypoints, and trajectory control to move between them.
